# Day-Planner
This is a real-time day scheduler with color coding. Time blocks for past events are colored grey, future events are green, and whichever time block is in the present time will be red. 
All data is stored and retrieved from local storage, so even after the browser has been refreshed or even closed, all the information entered will remain in the time block description when the browser is reopened.



## Criteria 
```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day

WHEN I click into a timeblock
